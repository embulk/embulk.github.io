Since [the last article](https://www.embulk.org/articles/2020/03/13/embulk-v0.10.html), we have released some `v0.10` versions with several experiments. We now have some more detailed plan of upcoming Embulk versions, `v0.10`, `v0.11`, and `v1.0`.

Next week from Tokyo, we are going to talk about the details in [an online meetup on Embulk and Digdag](https://techplay.jp/event/781988)!

Here is the slide deck for the meetup drafted before the meetup. Take a look if you are interested, and prepare questions.
