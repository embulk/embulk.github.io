Hi Embulk users,

Sorry that we haven't announced the release of `v0.9` in the mailing list. `v0.9.0` was released on Jan 30, 2018 (2 months ago) with almost the same with `v0.9.0-BETA`.

`v0.9.5` has already been released then with some fixes and updates. `v0.9.4` (Feb 14) looked stable enough from issues reported from users, and next `v0.9.5` fixed some more minor issues, with removing the annoying banner about this mailing list. :)

It's time to try `v0.9.5`!

Since later versions, we're considering to upgrade dependency libraries used in `embulk-core`, for example, Jackson, Guava, msgpack-java, and else. We're afraid some plugins may be impacted because dependencies of `embulk-core` are unfortunately leaked to plugins for the time being.

If you see any strange problems with later versions, such as `ClassNotFoundException` or `LinkageError`, please report that at: [https://github.com/embulk/embulk/issues](https://github.com/embulk/embulk/issues)

(We're also wondering if we could hide the dependencies from plugins, but that'd be a big change as well. It's still under discussion.)

Thanks for using and/or contributing to Embulk.
