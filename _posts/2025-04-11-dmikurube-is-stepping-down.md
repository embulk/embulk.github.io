As mentioned in another article "[Looking for long-term maintainers around the Embulk eco-system](https://www.embulk.org/articles/2024/11/28/looking-for-long-term-maintainers.html)", Dai Mikurube ([@dmikurube](https://github.com/dmikurube)), the author, has been working as the main maintainer of the Embulk project, as an employee of [Treasure Data](https://www.treasuredata.com/).

It has been a great journey with Embulk there. I was faced with a lot of interesting challenges, and I enjoyed tackling them. However, this time, I have decided to leave.

I will stay on as one of the maintainers and the Core Team members, with a consensus with the company. However, I can only spend part of my personal time on Embulk. I will no longer be the "main" maintainer. Please keep in mind that I will have no duties, I may be inactive for a while, and I may not respond to issues that are raised.

The company has shown no intention of taking a leadership role in the Embulk project and contributing to its maintenance. As a result, the Embulk project will have no _active_ maintainers, at least for a while.

If you would like the Embulk project to keep going, your help is still needed, as discussed in "[Looking for long-term maintainers around the Embulk eco-system](https://www.embulk.org/articles/2024/11/28/looking-for-long-term-maintainers.html)". Contact us at [Contributors wanted](https://github.com/orgs/embulk/discussions/categories/contributors-wanted) if you are willing to get involved. I am willing to give you some help as much as I can on my personal time.

Thank you all, the community!
