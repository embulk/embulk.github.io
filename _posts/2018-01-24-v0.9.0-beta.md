Hi Embulk users,

We've published Embulk `v0.9.0-BETA`. The proper `v0.9.0` is expected to be released in a week almost the same with this `BETA` unless problems are reported. Please try this `BETA`, and report issues at [https://github.com/embulk/embulk/issues](https://github.com/embulk/embulk/issues) if you see any!

Finally, `v0.9.0` will not contain the new planned features below yet. They will be added in next minor updates soon such as `v0.9.1` or `v0.9.2`.

- Binary type
- Reporter plugins

Major changes in `v0.9.0-BETA` from `ALPHA` are in `Timestamp`. New-style timestamp formats are introduced.

* Existing: `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%6N %z"`
    * (Compatible but problems found. May be deprecated by major updates (ex. `v0.10`))
* New 1 (Ruby): `"ruby:%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%6N %z"`
    * (Newer standard. Aims 100% compatible with Ruby's `Time.strptime`)
* New 2 (Java; experimental): `"java:uuuu-MM-dd HH:mm:ss XXXXX"`
    * (Experimental yet, but to be recommended in the future. Simply with `java.time`.)
