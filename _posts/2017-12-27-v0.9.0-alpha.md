Hi Embulk users,

We've just published Embulk `v0.9.0-ALPHA`!

Although it does not contain "new features" in `v0.9.0`, it includes almost all the "incompatibilities" expected in `v0.9.0`. You can try this `v0.9.0-ALPHA` for checking compatibility issues in your environments.

Download :
[https://dl.bintray.com/embulk/maven/embulk-0.9.0-ALPHA.jar](https://dl.bintray.com/embulk/maven/embulk-0.9.0-ALPHA.jar)

If you see problems which are not listed below, please report the problems in out GitHub Issues :

Incompatibilities introduced in `v0.9.0-ALPHA`:

1) `v0.9.0` no longer supports Java 7. `v0.9.0` works only on Java 8.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Some older versions of some plugins may not work since some SPI/API are removed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/embulk-announce/QDbRekBr1WA](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/embulk-announce/QDbRekBr1WA)

3) `v0.9.0` parses time zones (especially for summer time) in a bit different way.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`v0.8` interpreted time zones with Joda-Time's TZ database. `v0.9` interprets with JVM's (Java 8) java.time TZ database.

4) Embulk would be no longer released as a gem (`embulk.gem`).
---------------------------------------------------------------

Bundler users: you need to change your Gemfile-s.

For proper Embulk releases, use :
```
gem 'embulk'
```

For pre-releases like this `0.9.0-ALPHA`, use
```
gem 'embulk', '= 0.9.0.alpha'
```

This is because `embulk.gem` is not published, but embedded in `embulk-0.9.0-ALPHA.jar` in a gem structure.

5) Ruby (gem) plugins are installed into `~/.embulk/lib/gem` by default, not `~/.embulk/jruby/2.3.0`.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The install directory won't change again per JRuby version upgrade.
