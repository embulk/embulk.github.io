Hi Embulk users,

If you're using or planning to use the MapReduce Executor, please leave your feedback.

[https://github.com/embulk/embulk/issues/1119](https://github.com/embulk/embulk/issues/1119)

We now have difficulties to keep maintaining MapReduce Executor, and think about its future. Any option is on the table as of now -- which includes obsoleting it.

Thanks.
