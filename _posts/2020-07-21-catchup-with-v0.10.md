We announced the plan to Embulk v0.10. But, about plugins to catch up, the detailed information was described only in the slide deck at: [More detailed plan of Embulk v0.10, v0.11, and v1 -- Meetup!](https://www.embulk.org/articles/2020/07/01/meetup-20200709.html)

Here, we publish another page to summary how Java plugins to catch up with Embulk v0.10. The page would be updated according to Embulk updates.

Stay tuned at: [Java plugins to catch up with Embulk v0.10 from v0.9](https://dev.embulk.org/topics/catchup-with-v0.10.html)
